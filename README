Packagetastic is a new software packaging system for Linux. It is designed to 
replace traditional packaging systems, while being backwards compatible with 
them. For Example, you can create a Packagetastic package and install it, or 
have a Dpkg or RPM package automatically generated from it.

Development happens at:

Getting started on Debian:

	# install requirements:
	sudo apt-get install build-essential cdbs dh-make pbuilder fakeroot debhelper devscripts gnupg python-pexpect

	# create gpg key:
	gpg --no-use-agent --gen-key

	# setup pbuilder:
	cd ~
	echo "COMPONENTS=\"main contrib non-free\"" > ~/.pbuilderrc
	sudo pbuilder create

Getting started on Ubuntu:

	# install requirements:
	sudo apt-get install build-essential cdbs dh-make pbuilder fakeroot debhelper devscripts gnupg python-pexpect

	# create gpg key:
	gpg --no-use-agent --gen-key

	# setup pbuilder:
	cd ~
	echo "COMPONENTS=\"main restricted universe multiverse\"" > ~/.pbuilderrc
	sudo pbuilder create

	# Turn off the gpg use agent. This makes it so we
	# can sign the packages with the cli, instead of
	# the popup dialog box.
	sed -i 's/^use-agent$/#use-agent/' ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf

Getting started on Fedora systems:

	# add your user to the sudo group
	echo 'username ALL=(ALL) ALL' >> /etc/sudoers

	# install requirements:
	sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
	sudo yum install rpmdevtools pexpect

Packagetastic one time setup:
	# Setup your name, email, and password files
	# Make sure to use the same email and name as in your gpg key
	echo "Joe Packager" > packager_name
	echo "joe.packager@linux.com" > packager_email
	echo "password" > root_password
	echo "this is a secret" > gpg_password

Building packages:
	# Make sure you have a stem file for the package you want
	ls stems/hello.py

	# Download the source code mentioned in the stem file
	cd sources
	wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hello/hello-2.1.1.tar.gz
	cd ..

	# Run packagetastic with arguments for package and distro
	# For now, use ubuntu as the distro name instead of debian
	./packagetastic ubuntu hello
