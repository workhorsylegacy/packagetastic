Packagetastic is a Linux packaging system, that works with dpkg and rpm.

Right now it only works on 32 bit Ubuntu 10.04. Fedora is dissabled while the
project is rewritten.

Development happens at:
http://launchpad.net/packagetastic

Step #1 on Ubuntu:
	# install requirements:
	sudo apt-get install build-essential python-pexpect python-mako python-apt lsb_release

Step #1 on Fedora:
	# install requirements:
	sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"
	sudo yum install pexpect python-mako python-devel redhat-lsb

Step #2 - One time setup:
	# Get the code if you have not
	bzr branch lp:packagetastic
	cd packagetastic

	# Setup your name, and email files
	echo "Joe Packager" > packager_name
	echo "joe.packager@linux.com" > packager_email

Step #3 - Building packages:
	# Make sure you have a stem file for the package you want
	ls stems/hello.stem

	# Run packagetastic with arguments for package and distro
	# For now, use ubuntu as the distro name instead of debian
	sudo ./packagetastic build distro:=ubuntu package:=hello $UID
